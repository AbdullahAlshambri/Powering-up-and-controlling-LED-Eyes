# Powering-up-and-controlling-LED-Eyes

Here is a circuit to power and control two LEDs that serve as robot eyes. it consists of two parts:
* an electrical circuit to regulate the voltage from the source.
* an electronic circuit to help saving power via a process called PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).

## Electrical Circuit

The source here is presumed to be a 9 V battery. LEDs can not withstand this kind of voltage and current, to solve the problem a voltage regulator is added. In this circuit, an LM7805 voltage regulator is used to reduce the voltage to 5 V that feeds the electronic circuit. LM7805 needs other components to operate. To build the LM7805 circuit two capacitors are added in parallel with it as illustrated.

## Electronic Circuit

After reducing the voltage to 5 v, an NPN transistor is added to serve as a switch. Nevertheless, the base of the transistor is connected with an Arduino that functions as a waves generator. A wave of 60 HZ is then generated by the Arduino to switch the LEDs on and off to reduce the duty cycle to almost half.

Finally, the two circuits are added to two **on-series** LEDs to save power(one current) and to devide the regulated voltage.
