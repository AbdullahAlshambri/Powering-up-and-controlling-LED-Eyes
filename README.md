# Powering-up-and-controlling-LED-Eyes

This is a circuit to power and control two LEDs that surve as robot eyes. the circuit consists of two parts: an elctrical circuit to regulate the voltage from the source, and an electronic circuit to help saving power via a procecss called PWM(Pulse Width Modulation).

## Electrical Circuit

The source here it is presumed to be a 9 V battery, LEDs can not withstand this kind of voltage and current, thus a voltage regulator is added. In this circuit LM7805 voltage regulator is used to reduce the voltage to 5 V which then feeds the electronic circuit. LM7805 has its own circuit to operate; which is build by adding two capacitors on parallel with the component as shown.

## Electronic Circuit

After reducing the voltage to 5 v, a NPN transistor is added to serve as a switch. Neverthless, the base of the transistor is connected with an Arduino that functions as waves generator. A wave of 60HZ is then generated by the Arduino to switch on and off the LEDs to reduce the duty cycle to almost the half.

Finally, the two circuits are added to two on-series LEDs to save power(one current) and to devide the regulated voltage.
